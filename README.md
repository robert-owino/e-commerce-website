# e-commerce-website


This repository contains the code for an E-Commerce website designed to provide an immersive shopping experience. The website showcases a range of products and offers features such as a responsive navbar, a cart system, and the display of featured products.

### Project Structure

- The main HTML file `index.html` serves as the foundation of the website's structure, including the navigation bar, hero section, featured products, and cart overlay.
- The CSS styling is managed through the `styles.css` file, which enhances the visual appeal of the user interface.
- JavaScript functionalities are divided into multiple modules, each contributing to specific features of the website. The `toggleSidebar.js` module handles the navigation sidebar's behavior, the `toggleCart.js` module controls the cart overlay, and the `setupCart.js` module configures the cart display.
- The core functionality of fetching and displaying products is managed by the `fetchProducts.js`, `store.js`, and `displayProducts.js` modules.
- The main script file `index.js` orchestrates the website's initialization, product fetching, setup, and display.

### Features
